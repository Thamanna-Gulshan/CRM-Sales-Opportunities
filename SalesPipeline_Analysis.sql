Observation:
- There's no direct field that ties sales agents to specific accounts or their revenues

- If thereâ€™s a mapping of sales agents to specific accounts, we can use that to establish a valid join
Alternate possible solution:
- We can use Sales Pipeline Table
- The table has the data connecting agents to accounts, we can use it as the intermediary.
